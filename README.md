Management-Summary
===============================================================================

Background
---------------------------------------------------------------------
<div style="text-align: justify"> 
The faucet aerators control the flow rate to less than 10 l/m, allowing air entrainment and resulting in fine droplets. Furthermore, these faucets are not always used with constant flow rates. Compared to regular faucets, aerators compress the water flow into a higher-pressure discharge. They also add air bubbles to the water, which gives the impression that the flow of the water is greater. Mostly, the difference in the amount of water coming out of the faucet is unnoticeable. Additionally, it has been claimed by most aerator manufactures that their aerators can save up to 50% of water flow compared to the regular faucet. However, in this project, only the water flow from the geometry and only one flow rate will be considered. 
<!-- 
Contribution for the better enviroment by reducing the utilization of resourcess is eccential in this century. One of the natural resuorces that is ofened considered is the water. Water conservation have become necessity for the modern environment. By taking into these factors, technology has offered a water saving device for the householsds i.e. aerators. The aeration process used in kitchen and bathroom faucets regulates and reduces water consumption. This reduces water usage and results in non-splash flow, so these fittings in water taps act as water saving devices.
 </div>
<div style="text-align: justify"> 
The faucet aerators control the flow rate to less than 10 l/m, allowing air entrainment and resulting in fine droplets. As a result, the amount of water used is reduced. Therefore, in the morden households all of the faucets are equiped with aerators. These aerators reduce the flow of water by mixing the water with the air. The main function of the faucet areator is to devide the main stream of water into multiple small streams and introduce the air into it. when the air enters in the flow, automatically the volume of water flow will be reduced.
 </div>
 <div style="text-align: justify"> 
Compared to regular faucets, aerators compress the water flow into a higher pressure discharge. They also add air bubbles to the water, which gives the impression that the flow of the water is grater. Mostly, the difference in the amount of the water comming out of the faucet are unnoticeable. Aditionally, it has been clamimed by the most of aerator manufactures that their aerators can save upto 50% of water flow compared to the regular faucet. 
 </div>
 <div style="text-align: justify"> 
 Furthermore, these faucets are not always used with constant flow rates. Figure below shows the three flow rate of a kitchen faucet. It is visivile in these picture there are some air-bubbles are present in the folw streem of the water.

<!--This project is conducted in the process of learning CFD simulation in openfoam. Due to the complexity of the project and the time limitation it has been divided into two steps. In the first step, only the flow of water will be simulated and studied. Afterward, with the knowledge and experience, both material flows will be simulated.

### Simulation of steady-state with Laminar turbulence model
<!--####  Simplification of geometry. 
The flow on the aerator is via two screens on the pipe. Since only the water is considered as the flowing material, the air inlet can be ignored. Furthermore, the screens can be modeled with small diameter holes on the cross-section of the pipe. Additionally, the geometry has rotational symmetry from the central axis. Therefore, the geometry can be further simplified from the central axis.
#### Mesh creation 
The flow channel of the water from the screen is represented with the 1 and 2-mm diameter holes. therefore the mesh that will be created should be relatively small to have a decent mesh of the geometry. The cfMesh will be used to create the surface mesh.
#### simulation 
-->
The first simulation that will be conducted will be a steady-state simulation with the laminar turbulence model. It is expected that this simulation will provide a basic understanding of the flow of water through multiple screens. 

### Transient simulation with RANS(kOmmegaSST) turbulence model 
Since the steady state simulation showed the transient behaviour, it is necessary to do a transient simulation to have a better understanding of the flow. Therefore, a transient simulation with RANS(kOmmegaSST) turbulence model can be conducted.

Simulation Study 1 : Steady-State simulation with laminar turbulance model
===============================================================================


Reality Description
---------------------------------------------------------------------

### Geometry
There are two types of faucet aerators available in the market. They are categorized by how they are fitted on the tip of the faucet. An aerator that comes with an external thread and is placed inside the end of the tap is called male and with the internal thread is called female. Both of them come in standard dimensions as shown in the figure.

### Physics
The basic working principle of the faucet aerator is water flowing from two screens and mixing air in between while redirecting the flow of water by some obstacles. The flows of the fluids are shown below.

Model & Numerics
---------------------------------------------------------------------

### Geometry

The geometry has rotational symmetry from the central axis. Therefore, only a 60Â° span at the cross section from the central axis is taken into consideration for the simulation. The screens are modeled with small diameter holes on the cross-section of the pipe as shown in the figure below. Additionally, the flow governer and air inlet are ignored. Some of the basic dimensions are given below.

| Feature                     | Dimension                                   |

| Pipe Diameter               | 21 mm
| Pipe height                 | 24 mm
| Small hole diameter         | 1 mm
| No. of small hole           | 45

### Numerical Confidence
In the simulation after 200 steps of the iteration, the residuals are slightly less than 1e-1 and looking at the pressure probes, the values are in 1e-1. therefore, it can be said that the results are not good enough for numerical convergence.

 The velocity streams are time-dependent, which is a sign of the transient behavior of the flow. Thus, it is required to have another simulation to confirm the convergence and transient behavior.

Simulation Study 2 : Transient simulation with RANS turbulance model
===============================================================================
In this simulation, only the turbulence model is changed to the RANS-kOmegwSST model. All the other parameters are kept similar to the simulation study 1.

### Numerics

### Numerical Confidence
The residuals of the transient simulation of the flow for 1s are below 10e-4. After 0.6 s all of the residuals are steady. Similarly, the pressure probes are also steady with 10e-6 precision after 0.2 seconds.

Flow Analysis 
---------------------------------------------------------------------
The figure below shows the velocity distribution and the streamlines of the flow. It can be seen from the figure that the velocity is increased on the screens. Since the fluid is constrained to flow from those smaller channels, it was expected to have a higher velocity in those areas. Furthermore, streamlines also showcase the pressure distribution. Pressure is higher in the inlet and drops suddenly at the first screen and gradually increases and drops again at the second screen.   

<img src="./Images/areatortrans/velocity and streamline.png"  width="700" height="300">
fig :- Velocity,streamlines and vector plot at streamlines


The figures below show the velocity profile and pressure of the different regions. The velocity profile of these regions in the transient simulations at the middle section are not time-dependent.

fig :- Velocity and Pressure at Screen 2 (outlet).

The velocity profile of the inlet shows the friction on the wall. Therefore, it is close to zero at the wall. Similarly, the parabolic velocity profile at other locations is due to wall friction. Whereas, on screen 2, the profile is uneven. It is due to a combination of multiple velocity streams from screen 1. Moreover, with the given boundary conditions the pressure loss of the flow is about 0.641pa.

Conclusion
===============================================================================

Only water will flow from the faucet if the aerator's air inlet is blocked while it is in use. The internal geometry of the aerator at the faucet's tip causes the water flow to differ from that of a regular faucet. The screens used in this study have tiny, circular holes spread across the flow cross-section. These screens restrict water flow and lessen the cross-sectional area of the flow. It is similar to pinching a garden hose with your finger to increase flow velocity and lower pressure. Similarly, it is evident from the simulation that the water velocity increases and the pressure decrease at the aerator's outlet.
